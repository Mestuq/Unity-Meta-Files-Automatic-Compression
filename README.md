# Unity Meta Files Automatic Compression
![](https://github.com/Mestuq/Unity-Meta-Files-Automatic-Compression/blob/main/Assets/Plugins/UnityMetaFilesAutomaticCompression/Resources/Preview.png)

Have you ever been annoyed that UnityEditor generates ".meta" files for each file separately, doubling the number of files and making your code on GitHub unreadable? The above scripts solve this problem by archiving all ".meta" files into one file called "MetaFilesCompressed". Upon the first run of the Unity project, the script will automatically extract the files needed for the application to function properly. After each change to the files, the files in "MetaFilesCompressed" are automatically updated, eliminating the need to send ".meta" files to GitHub (thus, this file type has been added to gitignore), one MeteFilesCompressed.zip file is enough. Please note that the scripts require Python environment to be installed.
